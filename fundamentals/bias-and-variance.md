# Bias and Variance

## Bias: 

1. Definition: The inability of a machine learning method to capture the true relationship is called bias.
2. Example: When trying to fit a curve with a linear model\(since line cannot curve, it can never fits the curve perfectly\), we have a relatively large bias.
3. Summary: Reflects how a model fits the **real** relationship.

## Variance: 

1. Definition: The difference in fit between different datasets is called variance
2. Example: When trying to fit a curve with a squiggly line\(It has vastly different sum of loss for different datasets\), we have a relatively large variance. 
3. Summary: Reflects how a model can produce **consistently** predictions with different datasets.

## What we want to achieve?

A good balance method that can achieve low bias and low variance model
